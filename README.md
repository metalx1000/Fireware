Software for Fire Deparments

The current state of this software with mainly front ends for the programs.  The GUI front ends are written in HTML5 and uses JavaScript/jQuery for client side functions.  The server side scripts are written in PHP and are mostly static at this time.  For real life use the PHP files would be modified to interact with a data base to sort, store, and retreieve data.  Anyone with basic MySQL and PHP knowledge should easliy be able to make the needed changes to get these scripts working for real life use.  It's possible that in the future more will be done with the sever side scripts in this project, but don't expect it any time soon :)
